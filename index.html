              <h1>Understanding the Basics: What is HTML?</h1>
               <p>
                 Before I dive into HTML and CSS projects for beginners, I want to share why mastering the basics of HTML is crucial. HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the foundational building block of the web. It’s not a programming language, but a markup language used to define the structure and layout of a web page through various elements and tags.
               </p>
                <p> 
                  To me, HTML is like creating a framework for web content, similar to how an architect designs a building's blueprint. You would use tags to mark up text, insert images, create links, and layout web pages in formats that browsers can understand and display. These tags, the basic units of HTML, help differentiate between headings, paragraphs, lists, and other content types, giving the web its versatile and user-friendly nature.
                </p>

        <P>
            Every web developer starts somewhere, and for many that starting point is HTML. It's a language that empowers you to create, experiment, and develop digital experiences.
